# My portfolio project

## First of all

I still have to learn about responsiveness and more about HTML/CSS and this webosite is still not compatible for some screens and devices.
This is my portfolio project to make my website about my music work.
I have already started to work on this project back in July 2023 when I haven't learned about Git.
(You can visit [my older project on GitHub](https://github.com/chizuru-nina-yamauchi/9-Final-Project) to check my older project)
To keep working on this project from that point, I uploaded many files with one git push at the beginning and then I added new section, new icons, and organised my HTML this time.
