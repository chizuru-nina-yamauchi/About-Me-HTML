# My portfolio project

## First of all

This is a portfolio project and I have already worked on another portfolio project back in July 2023.
Therefore, I uploaded many files with one git push at the beginning.
But I added the new icons in the header, videos and photos in music/music vdieo sections, and credit section in addition to my old project.
